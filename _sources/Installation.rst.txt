Installation
=============
CoDIAC can be installed via `pip`, and directly from the Git repository. We recommend using conda to install the scientific packages `conda install anaconda` before installing CoDIAC. 

Pip
----
To install via pip, execute `pip install codiac`.


Tarball
---------
To install via a tarball, head over to the `Releases page <https://github.com/NaegleLab/PROJECT_PACKAGE/releases>`_ and download the latest stable tar release.

Afterwards, navigate to your downloads directory and execute the following commands, substituting <version> for the release's version number:
```
tar -xvf PROJECT_PACKAGE-<version>.tar.gz
cd PROJECT_PACKAGE-<version>
python setup.py install
```

Git
----
If you want to try out the latest commit, you can install directly from the Git repository by executing the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/NaegleLab/PROJECT_PACKAGE
cd PROJECT_PACKAGE.git
python setup.py install
```
